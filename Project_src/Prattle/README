Description.

First, when tou start conversation with the Prattle,
you need to input your credentials (username \n password).
If you are a new user you can type any combination. If it is not taken,
it will become your new credentials. If you are old user, you will have to type your password
until it is correct.
(When you log in you user is either CREATED or RETRIVED from the db)

When you successfully log in, you can:
-communicate with the server by typing special messages like "Hello"
-send messages to everyone by simply typing your message.
-send direct messages by typing user>your_message (where user is the name of the user you want to talk to)
-send same messages to many users by typing user1,user2,user3>your_message
-send group messages by typing group>>your_message
-send files by typing user>file (::text.txt, picture.png, etc. - files from the resources/send folder)
*when message is received it is saved in the resources/receive folder in the destination user machine

CRUD functionality:
-UPDATE new_password (updates the password of the current user)
-DELETE (deletes currently logged in user)
-JOIN group (adds current user to the group. creates group if there is no one)
-LEAVE group (removes current user from the group. deletes group if it is empty)
