Description.

First, when tou start conversation with the Prattle,
you need to input your credentials (username and password).
If you are a new user you can type any combination. If it is free,
it will become your new credentials.
(When you log in you user is either CREATEd or RETRIVEd from the db)

When you successfully log in, you can:
-communicate with the server by typing special messages like "Hello"
-send messages to everyone by simply typing your message.
-send direct messages by typing user>your_message (where user is the name of the user you want to talk to)
-send messages to a group of users by typing user1,user2,user3>your_message (same logic)

You can also manipulate the data of your user by typing:
-UPDATE new_password (updates the password of the current user)
-DELETE (deletes currently logged in user and ends the session)
-RETRIEVE (tells current user's password)

For this sprint, the DB is implemented simply as a text file db.txt.
